## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris. I'm a DevOps/Cloud/Infra/SRE Engineer.

I use **Terraform** (all clouds), **Bash**, **Python**, **Kubernetes** - and a little Ansible, Golang, PowerShell.

## Browse my main repos:

- [**Cloud DevOps Scripts**](https://github.com/chrisbuckleycode/cloud-devops-scripts) - Cloud/DevOps scripts
- [**Useful Scripts**](https://github.com/chrisbuckleycode/usefulscripts) - Personal scripts

Full Disclosure: I recommend using AI after gaining experience in a language to:
- Boost efficiency and speed up feature delivery
- Focus on architecture over syntax
- Correct AI errors effectively
